Major Enhancements

  -- Support for directed serial parsing of search and gene model documents. 
     Serial parsing offers improved memory and speed for simple BSML clients
     not requiring advanced use of the object layer's lookup tables.

  -- Support for the encoding of multi-sequence alignments.

  -- Improved testing suite offering integrity validation of the core 
     components of the low-level objects, BsmlDoc, BsmlBuilder, BsmlReader, 
     and both parsing mechanisms. 

  -- XML Schema validation of gene model and search documents. 

  -- Improved reference documents for gene model and search encodings.
